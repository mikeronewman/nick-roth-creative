# The Premise

This is an in-development website for Nick Roth Creative. Nick Roth Creative is a wedding photography business who tasked me with building a website that could help display their portfolio and maybe help them acquire some new business!

## Build Goals

This website will not be too dynamic, so I am leveraging the speed of a static site generator. This site is build in Eleventy, with Nunjucks templates, and gulp to preprocess my sass files. I plan on implementing with Contentful later on to allow the client to add their own photos and testimonials.
